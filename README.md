# DevOps Bible

**DevOps Bible** is a comprehensive resource dedicated to all things DevOps. This static site, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), covers a wide range of topics, including containerization, orchestration, CI/CD, cloud providers, configuration management, and more. It's designed to help both beginners and advanced professionals in the DevOps space.

## Visit the Website

The live version of this project is hosted at [devopsbible.com](https://devopsbible.com).

## Origins

This project evolved from an earlier DevOps guide I created. You can check out the original repository here: [mrn55/how-tos/devops-bible.md](https://github.com/mrn55/how-tos/blob/master/devops-bible.md). DevOps Bible aims to expand on that work, making the content more comprehensive and easily accessible.
